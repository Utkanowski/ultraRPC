Ultra customizable RPC for Rusherhack

**Not yet released to normal users**

to enable plugins, add the jvm flag: -Drusherhack.enablePlugins=true
drop plugin .jar files into .minecraft/rusherhack/plugins/ (you have to make this folder yourself)

Create the motd folder in the .minecraft folder, then create the motd.txt file in the motd folder.

ultraRPC Plugini is a more advanced version of Rusherhack's RichPresence module. (Even if it's not very advanced yet)

I haven't tested it yet because I'm not a Plus member. If you want to help or have a problem, contact me.
