Ultra customizable RPC for Rusherhack

**Not yet released to normal users**

to enable plugins, add the jvm flag: -Drusherhack.enablePlugins=true
drop plugin .jar files into .minecraft/rusherhack/plugins/ (you have to make this folder yourself)

Create the motd folder in the .minecraft folder, then create the motd.txt file in the motd folder.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Customizable MOTDs: Users can define their custom MOTDs in a motd.txt file placed inside the motd folder located in the .minecraft directory. These MOTDs are displayed on Discord RPC.

Automatic MOTD Updates: At specified intervals (MOTD_CHANGE_INTERVAL), the plugin automatically cycles through the MOTDs listed in the motd.txt file. This allows players to display different MOTDs on Discord RPC.

Server Recognition: Determines which server the player is currently on. If a player is on the "2b2t.org" server, the "Playing 2b2t.org" message is displayed.

Queue Status: If a player is in a queue on a server, the plugin also shows their position in the queue on Discord RPC.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ultraRPC Plugini is a more advanced version of Rusherhack's RichPresence module. (Even if it's not very advanced yet)

I haven't tested it yet because I'm not a Plus member. If you want to help or have a problem, contact me.
